### Seb Insua

Hi there, I'm Seb Insua, a software engineer and freelancer working on end-to-end product engineering from the user interface to the API and algorithm design.

I [write technical articles](https://sebinsua.com), post [programming ideas and experiments on my Gist](https://gist.github.com/sebinsua) and occasionally make open-source software. I'm always interested in new projects, so [feel free to drop me a line](mailto:me@sebinsua.com).
