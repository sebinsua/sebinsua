# Seb Insua

Hi there, I'm Seb Insua, a software engineer and freelancer working on end-to-end product engineering from the user interface to the API and algorithm design.

I [write technical articles](https://sebinsua.com), post [programming ideas and experiments on my Gist](https://gist.github.com/sebinsua) and occasionally make open-source software. I'm always interested in new projects, so [feel free to drop me a line](mailto:me@sebinsua.com).

## Selected posts

* [_"Is dismissing the algorithmic tech interview a memetic hazard?"_](https://sebinsua.com/algorithmic-bathwater)
  * This contains a decision tree to help navigate what algorithm to apply to different kinds of problems.
* [_"Bridging the gap between neural networks and functions"_](https://sebinsua.com/bridging-the-gap)
  * This contains a detailed breakdown of the mathematics and code involved in backpropagation.
* [_"Use notation to unmask relationships when problem solving"_](https://sebinsua.com/use-notation-to-unmask-relationships)
  * This shows how formulating problems using equations can sometimes help you towards a more optimal solution.
