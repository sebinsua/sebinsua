software engineer working end-to-endâ€”from the bite to the bit. i start at the problem and dig through the layers: interface, behavior, protocol, algorithm.

i [write technical posts](https://sebinsua.com), publish [experiments on gist](https://gist.github.com/sebinsua), and sometimes ship open-source code. if you're working on something hard, [drop me a line](mailto:me@sebinsua.com).
